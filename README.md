# Accounting Backend Prototype

This project serves as a prototype for an accounting system for the new Intranet.  
The backend is a REST API written in Java using the Spring framework.

> :warning: **Warning**: This is only a prototype. The code is experimental and **dirty**.

The main intent of this prototype is to experiment with various Spring features and see how the integration with Keycloak would work.
